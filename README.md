# Amoeba PCBs

A collection of PCBs for use with custom handwired mechanical keyboard in order in the make life much easier. Think of it like a hybrid between having a full PCB and completely handwiring, where each switch has its own PCB that can be connected to the other PCBs to form the keyboard matrix, allowing for more flexibility than a custom PCB, but making the process of handwiring much easier by not having to solder wires to pins, and allowing for the use of SMD components.

This is a fork of the original repo due to the creator not responding to PRs, or providing much documentation for these files.
